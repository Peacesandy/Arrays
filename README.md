Question one

Mutating Array
An immutable value is one that, once created, can never be changed. In JavaScript, primitive values such as numbers, strings and booleans are always immutable. However, data structures like objects and arrays are not.

By mutation I mean changing or affecting a source element. The goal is to keep the original element unchanged at all times.

Non-mutation Array
